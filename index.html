    <h1>The Avoidant Ex Monika Szafon</h1>
    <p><strong>Love-Bombed & Ghosted:</strong> How My Narcissistic Avoidant Ex Played Me Like a Fool.</p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>I dated this girl for almost a year my first long-distance relationship. She lived in the UK, and I was new to the whole distance thing, but at first, it felt amazing. We talked every day, shared everything online, and after a few weeks, she flew to Paris to meet me for three days.

It was intense. She love-bombed me with so much affection, so much attention and of course, I fell hard. I knew I was in trouble from the start.</p>

    <h2>The Slow Unraveling</h2>
    <p>The first few months were perfect. Fast replies, deep conversations, constant calls. But once the honeymoon phase ended, she started pulling away. Messages became slower. She rarely initiated calls. I was the only one keeping us alive.

Then came the first breakup a sudden "I can't do this" text out of nowhere. She came back hours later like nothing happened. That's when I realized something was wrong. I started researching and discovered avoidant attachment. Suddenly, everything made sense:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She couldn't handle emotional intimacy</li>
      <li>Any conflict made her shut down completely</li>
      <li>Every serious conversation ended with her threatening to leave</li>
    </ul>
<p>I hate her for this: in every argument, in every moment we needed to connect deeper, she only ever chose one option break up. Like a broken record. No working through it, no compromise just the nuclear button, over and over.

Her moods swung violently affectionate at breakfast, cold by lunchtime. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified that one wrong word would make her detonate. How do you build a future with someone who refuses to stay through the hard parts?</p>
    <h2>The Cycle of Breakups</h2>
    <p>Seven breakups. Seven fucking times...</p>
    <p>And every single time, I begged. Like a desperate fool, I crawled back, pleading for another chance, swearing we could fix it. I gave her everything my heart, my trust, my goddamn future and she treated it like a joke.

I had plans. Real ones. Trips, a home, a life built together. I saw it all so clearly. But to her? I was just a placeholder. A temporary distraction until something better came along.

Now she's out there playing the victim? Telling everyone I was the problem? After all the lies, the mind games, the way she made me feel like I was begging for scraps of affection?

Here’s the cruel truth: I was the only one trying.</p>
    <p>While I was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching how to love an avoidant partner</li>
      <li>Going to therapy to "fix" myself</li>
      <li>Swallowing every hurtful comment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>She was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Running every time things got real</li>
      <li>Using me for attention when it suited her</li>
      <li>Discarding me like trash the second she got bored</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Final Betrayal</h2>
    <p>The last discard was the cruelest: "I never loved you. I was just pretending." Then she:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blocked me everywhere within minutes</li>
      <li>Told everyone I was the toxic one</li>
      <li>Was probably already lining up her next distraction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Already moved on to someone new (probably)</li>
      <li>✅ Painting me as the villain to everyone</li>
      <li>✅ Never taking accountability for the damage she caused</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Love shouldn't leave you lonely</li>
      <li>Their trauma isn’t your responsibility. You can’t fix someone who won’t face themselves.</li>
      <li>When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Her actions spoke louder than all her empty words.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>She was right about one thing: we were strangers. Because the person I loved never really existed. That perfect girl from the first few months? Just a mirror she held up to reflect what I wanted to see.

Now? I’m picking up the pieces. Learning to trust again. And most importantly, learning to choose myself first.</p>
