    <h1>The Avoidant Ex</h1>
    <p><strong>Love-Bombed & Ghosted:</strong> How My Narcissistic Avoidant Ex Played Me Like a Fool.</p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>I dated this girl for almost a year my first long-distance relationship. She lived in the UK, and I was new to the whole distance thing, but at first, it felt amazing...</p>

    <h2>The Slow Unraveling</h2>
    <p>The first few months were perfect... I was the only one keeping us alive.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She couldn't handle emotional intimacy</li>
      <li>Any conflict made her shut down completely</li>
      <li>Every serious conversation ended with her threatening to leave</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Cycle of Breakups</h2>
    <p>Seven breakups. Seven fucking times...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching how to love an avoidant partner</li>
      <li>Going to therapy to "fix" myself</li>
      <li>Swallowing every hurtful comment</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Running every time things got real</li>
      <li>Using me for attention when it suited her</li>
      <li>Discarding me like trash the second she got bored</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Final Betrayal</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blocked me everywhere within minutes</li>
      <li>Told everyone I was the toxic one</li>
      <li>Was probably already lining up her next distraction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Already moved on to someone new (probably)</li>
      <li>✅ Painting me as the villain to everyone</li>
      <li>✅ Never taking accountability for the damage she caused</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Love shouldn't leave you lonely</li>
      <li>Their trauma isn't your responsibility</li>
      <li>When someone shows you who they are, believe them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now? I'm picking up the pieces...</p>

    <h2>Receipts That Still Haunt Me</h2>

    <p><strong>To anyone reading this:</strong> If you're loving someone who makes you feel alone, remember you deserve someone who stays.</p>
