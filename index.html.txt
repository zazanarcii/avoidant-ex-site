    <p><strong>Love-Bombed & Ghosted:</strong> How My Narcissistic Avoidant Ex Played Me Like a Fool.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Tous les articles</a></p>

    <p>I dated this girl for almost a year — my first long-distance relationship. She lived in the UK, and I was new to the whole distance thing, but at first, it felt amazing. We talked every day, shared everything online, and after a few weeks, she flew to Paris to meet me for three days.</p>

    <p>It was intense. She love-bombed me — so much affection, so much attention — and of course, I fell hard. I knew I was in trouble from the start.</p>

    <h2>The Slow Unraveling</h2>
    <p>The first few months were perfect. Fast replies, deep conversations, constant calls. But once the honeymoon phase ended, she started pulling away. Messages became slower. She rarely initiated calls. I was the only one keeping us alive.</p>

    <p>Then came the first breakup  a sudden "I can't do this" text out of nowhere. She came back hours later like nothing happened. That's when I realized something was wrong. I started researching and discovered avoidant attachment. Suddenly, everything made sense:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She couldn't handle emotional intimacy</li>
      <li>Any conflict made her shut down completely</li>
      <li>Every serious conversation ended with her threatening to leave</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I hate her for this: in every argument, in every moment we needed to connect deeper, she only ever chose one option: break up. Like a broken record. No working through it, no compromise — just the nuclear button, over and over.</p>

    <p>Her moods swung violently — affectionate at breakfast, cold by lunchtime. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified that one wrong word would make her detonate. How do you build a future with someone who refuses to stay through the hard parts?</p>

    <h2>The Cycle of Breakups</h2>
    <p>Seven breakups. Seven fucking times.</p>

    <p>And every single time, I begged. Like a desperate fool, I crawled back, pleading for another chance, swearing we could fix it. I gave her everything — my heart, my trust, my goddamn future — and she treated it like a joke.</p>

    <p>I had plans. Real ones. Trips, a home, a life built together. I saw it all so clearly. But to her? I was just a placeholder. A temporary distraction until something better came along.</p>

    <p>Now she's out there playing the victim? Telling everyone I was the problem? After all the lies, the mind games, the way she made me feel like I was begging for scraps of affection?</p>

    <p>Here's the cruel truth: I was the only one trying.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching how to love an avoidant partner</li>
      <li>Going to therapy to "fix" myself</li>
      <li>Swallowing every hurtful comment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>She was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Running every time things got real</li>
      <li>Using me for attention when it suited her</li>
      <li>Discarding me like trash the second she got bored</li>
    </ul>

    <p>She wants me to be the villain? Good. Because villains don't just walk away. They don't sit quietly while someone ruins their name.</p>

    <p>I won't lie  I've thought about revenge. About exposing her for the coward she is. About making sure everyone knows exactly how she destroys people and walks away like it's nothing.</p>

    <p>But here's the ugly truth: She's not worth it.</p>

    <h2>The Final Betrayal</h2>
    <p>The last discard was the cruelest: "I never loved you. I was just pretending." Then she:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blocked me everywhere within minutes</li>
      <li>Told everyone I was the toxic one</li>
      <li>Was probably already lining up her next distraction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When I flew to the UK for Christmas after five months apart, she treated me like a stranger:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flinched when I tried to touch her</li>
      <li>Slept as far away as possible in bed</li>
      <li>Said "I love you" like the words burned her tongue</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <p>It's been a month now. I'm shattered. Meanwhile, she's:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Already moved on to someone new (probably)</li>
      <li>✅ Painting me as the villain to everyone</li>
      <li>✅ Never taking accountability for the damage she caused</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I went to therapy for her. I worked on myself for her. And what did she do? Nothing. Just kept running.</p>

    <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Love shouldn't leave you lonely:</strong> If you're constantly starving for basic affection, it's not love.</li>
      <li><strong>Their trauma isn't your responsibility:</strong> You can't fix someone who won't face themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>When someone shows you who they are, believe them:</strong> Her actions spoke louder than all her empty words.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>She was right about one thing  we were strangers. Because the person I loved never really existed. That perfect girl from the first few months? Just a mirror she held up to reflect what I wanted to see.</p>

    <p>Now? I'm picking up the pieces. Learning to trust again. And most importantly learning to choose myself first.</p>

    <p class="section-title">To anyone reading this:</p>
    <p>If you're loving someone who makes you feel alone, remember you deserve someone who stays. Someone who chooses you as fiercely as you choose them.</p>
